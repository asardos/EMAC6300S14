Thesis- road map- argument- go in order of thesis and what you've layed out in thesis, needs to be arguable and have two 
sides-if no highlight- wasn't sure- should be an argument

Organization: 
Global Organization- follow the road map
Parapraph Organization- one subject- know what it is about by first sentence- the topic sentence- topic is signaled through
a topic sentence. Topic sentence then evidence.
Between paragraphs- transitions in between either the first sentence or the last sentence of the paragraph
helping organize globally-maybe contrasting something or digging deeper into the topic
flow from paragraph to paragraph- 
evidence- needs to be specific not just naming examples- build an argument
reverse outline- look at paper and see if you really talked about what you said you were going to talk about, how ideas 
connect and how they build on one another

Use of sources-
Sources are just cruotons if you don't explain them. Need context with quotes and analysis. We are over relying on source
to make argument for us- we need to analyze. 
When to quote or paraprhase- we need to paraprahse most of the time. 
If the language is so specific and you might lose something you should do a direct quote. 
Use a paraphrase in most cases. 

If you do a direct quote- give some context but try to paraphrase
don't let quote do the work for you, explain how quote or paraphrase is relevant to argument- connect quote to argument. 
Use quote to support ideas, don't rely on quote.
Paraphrase when possible.
Contextualiz and analyze.
